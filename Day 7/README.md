## ESLINT

_ESLint allows you to specify the JavaScript language options you want to support. By default, ESLint expects ECMAScript 5 syntax. You can override that setting to enable support for other ECMAScript versions as well as JSX by using parser options._

## UNIT TESTING

_Unit tests reduce number of bugs, provide accurate documentation, and improve design._
